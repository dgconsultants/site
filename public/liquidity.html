        Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation. It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger's maintenance and development. "Mining" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again.
        <br>
        Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it?
        <br>
        The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining: to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a "decentralized" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.
      </p>

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">The latest on bitcoin mining fraud</div>
        The ongoing hype about cryptocurrency trading and the vast sums of digital wealth some have made (and lost) in crypto markets is a strong lure for some would-be investors. But the complexity of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) schemes based on it have also created an environment where criminals can draw victims in, using the complexity as camouflage for fake apps, malicious contracts, and other schemes that make the victims think they’re on the road to wealth while getting them to turn over more and more currency.
        <br>
        We’ve already reported on one type of scheme, which we’ve labelled CryptoRom­–in which potential targets are approached on mobile dating applications and lured into messaging with someone posing as a romantic interest, and then brought into a fake cryptocurrency investment scheme bolstered by fake trading applications and websites. But while we were investigating that scheme, another practically dropped into my lap: a Twitter direct message invited me to join in “liquidity mining research”.
      </p>

      <img class="my-5 mx-auto"  src="./images/image 19.png" alt="">
      <p class="my-5">
        This interaction led to an investigation uncovering a number of fraud rings based on “liquidity mining,” a form of cryptocurrency-based decentralized finance (DeFi) that even in its legitimate form is a highly complex endeavor. The mechanics of liquidity mining in its legitimate form provide the perfect cover for old fashioned swindles re-minted for the cryptocurrency age.
        Criminals have used the complexity of the real thing to provide cover for a variety of scams, luring victims with the promise of extraordinary returns on investment. We found a number of these rings, operating primarily from China and using a mixture of fraudulent blockchain contracts, websites and applications to raid victims’ crypto wallets while making them believe they were making daily profits. Like the other crypto scams we follow, these have evolved from being focused on Asia into a global phenomenon. As we were researching one scam, the Washington Post reported about the victim of another liquidity mining scam that closely followed the pattern of the CryptoRom sha zhu pan scams we’ve reported about in the past.
      </p>

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">What is liquidity mining</div>
        Legitimate liquidity mining exists to make it possible for decentralized finance (DeFi) networks to automatically process digital currency trades. DeFi is an emerging financial technology that uses a blockchain-based distributed ledger similar to that used by cryptocurrencies to adjudicate trades between different types of crypto—governed by trading protocols built into the ledger itself.
        <br>
        Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges act as “market makers” for trades out of their deposits. Coinbase and other exchanges often reward larger investors (with reduced trading fees and other benefits) for allowing portions of their deposits to be used to guarantee the exchange has enough of popularly-traded pairs of cryptocurrency to assure trades can be handled. For example, if someone wants to cash out of Ethereum and exchange it for a “stablecoin” such as Tether (USDT), the exchange needs to have enough USDT available in reserves to make that trade and fulfill the transaction. The same is true in the other direction.
        <br>
        DeFi exchanges do trades differently—they’re executed by a protocol built into their networks known as Automated Market Makers (AMMs). Smart contracts built into the DeFi network have to rapidly determine the relative value of the currencies being exchanged and execute the trade. Since there is no centralized pool of crypto for these distributed exchanges to pull from to complete trades, they rely on crowdsourcing to provide the pool of cryptocurrency capital required to complete a trade—a liquidity pool.
        <br>
        To create the liquidity pool—which usually handles transactions between a single pair of cryptocurrencies—investors commit equal values of both cryptocurrencies to the pool, tying them on the blockchain to the smart contract. In exchange for lending that crypto to the pool, the contributors get a reward based on a percentage of the trading fees associated with the DeFi protocol. The “mining” part comes from liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens)—a representation of the share of the liquidity pool contributed by the investor.
        The LP tokens themselves are in essence another cryptocurrency, pegged to the value of the percentage of the pool they’re associated with.
        <br>
        Holding the tokens usually comes with benefits: a percentage of trading fees, and other rewards. There is also risk of loss—for example, the value of the pool of crypto may fall, and therefore the cashout value of the tokens could drop below the initial buy-in cost. But as long as the people behind the tokens don’t take the assets in the pool and run, there is at least a way for investors to get off the merry-go-round.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, there are several ways things can go awry if the people behind the liquidity pool are unethical—or flat-out criminal. There is no regulation of DeFi exchanges, and the only thing guaranteeing they’re on the up-and-up is the smart contract code built into the DeFi network’s (usually Ethereum-based) blockchain. But if the tokens get cancelled—or there was never really a pool backing them at all—that all goes out the window. There is ample opportunity for digital Ponzi schemes, fraudulent tokens, and flat-out theft.

        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Protecting potential victims</div>
        Success has bred copycats in the crypto scam world, and each new variant of the schemes developed by those trying to expand on the CryptoRom/ sha zhu pan playbook tries to expand the pool of potential victims in different ways.
        <br>
        A lack of protections, regulation, reliable information on cryptocurrency investment and international cooperation by law enforcement in ending these schemes has created the perfect cover for well-run scams. With much of the world relying on social networking sites, WhatsApp and Telegram as a source for information, the scammers have turned to these platforms to lure victims and keep them engaged until as much money as possible is extracted from them—particularly targeting more vulnerable people who use these services in search of friends and companionship as well as ways to extend their wealth.
        To prevent even more widespread fraud, user education is vital. People need to be made aware that these scams exist, and how to spot them. Cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, and others can move to rapidly block domains and wallets associated with scams.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, while law enforcement can take action in some cases, it is highly unlikely that these international scams can be shut down or interdicted by law enforcement alone.
