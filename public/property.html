      <p class="my-5">
        Fraud and investment scams abound at all levels of the real estate market – whether it be a contractor who charges hundreds of dollars for work not done to an "investment agent" who embezzles hundreds of millions – protecting yourself can require a measure of vigilance and legwork, but it can also come down to exercising scepticism and common sense.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-4xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Some of the Most Common Types of Property Scams</h3>

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Title fraud</div>
        Although relatively rare, one of the most devastating frauds for property owners is title fraud. This type of fraud starts with identity theft. The scammer will use false documents to pose as the property owner, registers forged documents transferring a property to his or her name, and then gets a new mortgage against the property. After securing a mortgage or line of credit, the criminal takes the cash and leaves the owner on the hook for future payments.
        <br>
        While an identity thief may get a forced discharge of an existing mortgage, it is generally held that fraudsters are more likely to go after homes that are free and clear of mortgages: these have fewer complications and they tend to be held by older people who may be less aware about how to guard against identity theft. Criminal Services Intelligence Canada notes that homeowners who rent out their homes or who have no existing mortgages on high-value properties are more vulnerable to being targeted in title-fraud schemes as a large mortgage can be secured with the property.
        Sale of a fraudulently held property may also occur, but it is much rarer as potential buyers are unlikely to consider a purchase without inspecting a property.
        
        <img class="my-5 mx-auto" src="./images/Rectangle 208 (8).png" alt="">

        "Title insurance" is the best protection against this type of fraud. As well as protecting against title fraud, it also guards a new owner from against existing liens against a property's title (such as unpaid debts from utilities, mortgages and unpaid property taxes), encroachment issues (a structure on a property needs to be removed because it is on your neighbour's property) and errors in surveys and public records.
        <br>
        In addition to title fraud by strangers, there have been cases where fraud has been perpetrated by spouses and business partners. For instance, one spouse may mortgage a property for their own benefit by using an accomplice to impersonate their spouse. Fraud can also occur through breach of an undertaking, where the lawyer or notary fails to pay off and obtain a discharge of a mortgage, instead absconding with the funds that had been intended to be used to pay an existing mortgage.
        <br>
      </p>

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Foreclosure and home-equity fraud</div>
        Criminals and criminal enterprises can take advantage of property owners who find themselves in a cash crunch, being short on funds for liabilities such as mortgage payments or other purposes. Two common scams that exploit a victim's need for cash are foreclosure fraud and home-equity fraud.oreclosure fraud occurs when a property owner who is having difficulty making mortgage payments is approached by a criminal offering a loan to cover expenses and consolidate loans, in exchange for upfront fees and an agreement to transfer the property title. However, in contrast to real debt consolidation programs, the criminal will keep all the payments made by the owner and ignore bills and taxes. The criminal then remortgages the property and absconds with the money, leaving the former property owner without the home but still in debt.
        
        <img class="my-5 mx-auto" src="./images/Rectangle 208 (9).png" alt="">

        Cash-crunched property owners or investors seeking can be vulnerable to other scams or unscrupulous behaviour to tap equity. There is always risk when leveraging properties, but a legitimate bank, broker or private lender should be forthright when explaining risks. However, those looking to borrow on equity should be alert for less scrupulous lenders, such as those who invite owners to embellish their application by exaggerating income, down payment or property assessment value sources in order to secure a larger loan.
        <br>
        Organized crime groups often pretend they are buying or selling properties that are much larger, newer or more recently renovated than other homes in the area. These properties receive fraudulently inflated values through illicit property flipping from which a large mortgage is obtained. When the criminals deliberately default on the mortgage, financial institutions and end buyers are left with an overvalued mortgage (or worse, former property owners are without holdings, in debt and possibly implicated in the fraud).
        <br>
      </p>

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Online rental/sale scams.</div>
        In these scams, rental property is advertised (usually at low costs) on online classified sites like Craigslist or Kijiji. The ads use information and photos describing the property that has been "scraped" from legitimate ads, such as those on the MLS. A scammer will impersonate the landlord, property manager or estate agent and will respond to emails and calls from prospective tenants. The scammer indicates he or she is unable to meet a prospective renter at the property, and instead proposes a meeting off site to exchange keys, sign a tenancy agreement and collect rental deposits. Victims may only learn they've been duped when they show up at a property to discover that it is already occupied.
        <br>
        Provincial and regional Realtor and real estate associations have warned members to be alert for this type of fraud, which has been common in major markets, but there is little a property owner can do to prevent image or data scraping. Property owners can search for the addresses of their units on search engines and they can use services like Google Image Search to help discover if a scraped picture from MLS or another online source is being used illicitly. Property owners should also digitally watermark any photos they use in rental ads, including business contact details and website.

        <img class="my-5 mx-auto" src="./images/Rectangle 208 (10).png" alt="">

        While rental scams are common, online classified advertising and social media have also been used for investment scams and property fraud. Things to be alert for in such listings include claims of urgency, such as "must sell now," promises of high returns or "low-cost/no-cost" financing. These sort of claims are usually too good to be true, and they also can be prevalent in off-line scams.

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Property Investment seminars and courses</div>
        Educating yourself about property investment can be essential for success, but prospective investors should be alert and do their research on seminar providers. There are legitimate speakers and seminars that provide beneficial information, others exist primarily to take money from the credulous … and there are some that are in between.
        <br>
        Prospective investors should be cautious when it comes to seminars or courses that offer investor education. The value of the information provided can vary wildly, as can the costs. Some may be free, with sponsorship by a company or association, others will charge money, ranging from nominal amounts to upwards of tens of thousands of dollars. Still, even if someone pays for a course that provides basic information that could be found through a simple Internet search, it does not mean that the seminar was a scam. A rip-off may charge excessive prices but be completely illegal, but a scam typically involves legal wrongdoing, misrepresentation or fraud.
        <br>
        One common type of seminar is designed to hook buyers into "sure-fire" investments that are promoted by the seminar hosts. Potential investors may be invited to these seminars through an ad in a newspaper or magazine, a phone call, an email or other method. These seminars may include a motivational speaker, an "investment expert" or a "self-made millionaire."

      <p class="my-5">
        <div class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">Home Improvement scams</div>
        As well as being cautious about big investments, property owners should be alert to smaller-level scams. The Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus listed "rogue door-to-door contractors" as among their top 10 scams of 2013.
        <br>
        These operators may come with unsolicited offers and deals that are too good to be true. Typical approaches include: offers to seal or repave a driveway, or a roofer who can work cheaply using leftover material from a previous job. BBB warns that fraudulent "contractors" will use high pressure sales tactics and offers of a one-time deal to entice consumers.
        <br>
        The BBB advises that property owners take the time to do due diligence. Property owners should get the company, name, address and ensure that all verbal promises are backed by a written contract. A scammer may ask for pay in cash or via a cheque and offer to come back at another time to finish the job. After cash changes hands, the BBB says, "you will probably never see them or your money again."
        <br>
        Generally, for the hiring of any contractor, it is advisable for a property owner to check references and ensure that the company or person has a reputation for fair dealing and quality work. This can be good sense when dealing with legitimate contractors, ensuring that you are likely to receive such as on-time and on-budget estimates.

      <h3 class="text-4xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">How to avoid investment scams</h3>
      <img class="my-5 mx-auto" src="./images/Rectangle 208 (12).png" alt="">

      <p class="my-5">
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-loose">
          <li>
            Statistics and testimonials can be faked. Scammers want you to believe their program is always successful. They might show reviews or testimonials by people who’ve used their program and made lots of money. But those could be paid actors or made-up reviews. You have no way of confirming their stories.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scammers exaggerate the significance of current events. Scammers follow the headlines and use current events to make their investment opportunity seem exciting, innovative, and timely. They want you to feel pressured to commit now without having fully researched the offer.
          </li>
          <li>
            No one can guarantee a specific amount of return on an investment. Scammers might claim that you can make thousands of dollars per day or per month for life. But they don’t tell you the risks. No one can guarantee that an investment will be successful. And if you ask questions about the investment, they might give you vague answers and focus only on how much money you’ll supposedly make.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Consider the risk. Be particularly suspicious of promoters who play down risk or make written risk disclosures sound like only routine formalities required by the government so you’d sign without thinking much about them. Later, when you try to recover the money you lost, dishonest promoters could use those same risk disclosures against you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Independently verify claims. Never invest based solely on what you read in an online newsletter, bulletin board posting, or blog. Scammers often use news stories about the success of legitimate companies as bait. They’ll often claim that their "opportunity" is similar to a proven hot money-maker — when, really, it’s not. Make sure that you research the investment opportunity carefully before you commit.
          </li>
        </ul>  
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-3xl text-blue-800 mt-10 mb-3">How to research investment opportunities</h3>

      <img class="my-5 mx-auto" src="./images/Rectangle 208 (13).png" alt="">

      <p class="my-5">
        Real investments demand time and careful consideration. Before you make an investment, it’s good to take time to consult someone you trust and who you know has your best interests in mind. It’s also important to do some research.
        Start by making sure your computer’s security software is up to date, and always practice basic computer security on any computer you use to access financial accounts. Then, once you’re ready to start researching the potential investments, here are some things to consider:
        <br>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-loose">
          <li>
            The company, its officials, and promoters might already have a reputation. Look for published information about the company. Do a search online with the name of the company, officials, or promoters plus words like “review,” “scam,” or “complaint.” Look through several pages of search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many investment frauds involve offerings of unregistered securities. Generally, offers to sell securities must be registered with the SEC or be eligible for an exemption. To see whether an investment is registered, check the SEC's EDGAR database and call your state securities regulator for more information about the company and the people promoting it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many securities frauds involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms. Check out the background, including registration or license status, of anyone recommending or selling an investment, using the free simple search tool on Investor.gov.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find out where the company’s stock trades. Some companies can’t meet the listing requirements of a national securities exchange. The securities of these companies trade instead in the "over-the-counter" (OTC) market and are quoted either directly from a broker-dealer or on OTC trading systems, like the OTC Link ATS. Stocks that trade on the OTC market may have increased price volatility (drastic price changes in short periods of time), less publicly available information, and lack liquidity (the ability to buy and sell the stock quickly without substantially impacting its price). These factors make some OTC stocks more risky and susceptible to manipulation by scammers.
          </li>
        </ul>
